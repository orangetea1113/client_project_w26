            <p>When seeking to build professional relationships, keep these golden rules in mind:</p>
            
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>DO</th>
                        <th>DON'T</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Keep it short:</strong> Aim for under 100 words.</td>
                        <td><strong>Never ask for a job:</strong> Build the relationship first.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Establish a time frame:</strong> Ask for a specific 20-minute slot.</td>
                        <td><strong>Don't send your resume first:</strong> Only send it if asked.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Personalize:</strong> Show you've done your research.</td>
                        <td><strong>Don't ask Google-able questions:</strong> Ask for insights, not facts.</td>

            <h3>How to Reach Out: The 5-Point Email</h3>
            <p>
                Effective networking emails should follow this 5-point structure:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Hook:</strong> Mention your connection first (e.g., "As a fellow UMSI student...").</li>
                <li><strong>The Why:</strong> Generalize your interest (e.g., "I am interested in the work you are doing at Google...").</li>
                <li><strong>The Ask:</strong> Keep it low pressure (e.g., "I'd love to ask you a few questions...").</li>
                <li><strong>The Constraint:</strong> Define the time (e.g., "Would you be open to a 20-minute chat?").</li>
                <li><strong>The Control:</strong> Handle the scheduling (e.g., "I can work around your availability").</li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>How do I follow up after a networking meeting?</strong><br>
                Send a thank-you email within 24 hours, mentioning specific points from your conversation and expressing your appreciation for their time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What if I don't get a response to my initial outreach?</strong><br>
                It's okay to send one polite follow-up email after a week or two. If you still don't hear back, respect their time and consider reaching out to someone else.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How can I maintain my network over time?</strong><br>
                Stay in touch by sharing relevant articles, congratulating them on achievements, or checking in periodically without asking for favors.
