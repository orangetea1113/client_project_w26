            <h2>Building Your Interview Skills</h2>
            <p>
                Successful interviews require preparation, practice, and a positive mindset. Here are some key strategies to help you excel in your interviews:
            </p>
            <h3>The Golden Rule: The STAR Method</h3>
            <p>
                When answering behavioral questions (e.g., "Tell me about a time you failed"), use the <strong>STAR Method</strong> to structure a clear, compelling story.
            </p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>S - Situation:</strong> Briefly set the scene (Who, when, where?).</li>
                    <li><strong>T - Task:</strong> What was the problem or goal you were working toward?</li>
                    <li><strong>A - Action:</strong> What did YOU specifically do? (Use "I" statements, not "We").</li>
                    <li><strong>R - Result:</strong> What was the outcome? Quantify it if possible (e.g., "Improved efficiency by 20%").</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Ace the Virtual Interview</h3>
            <p>
                Most initial screens and tech interviews happen remotely. Treat your setup as part of your professional appearance.

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eye Contact:</strong> Look at the <em>camera lens</em>, not the screen, when you are speaking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Face a window or light source. Avoid strong backlighting (which makes you look like a shadow).</li>
                    <li><strong>Tech Check:</strong> Test your microphone and internet connection 10 minutes before the call.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Background:</strong> If your room is messy, use a blurred background or a professional virtual background.</li>
